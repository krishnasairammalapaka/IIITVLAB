            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                A mono-alphabetic substitution cipher is a method of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter consistently throughout the message. It's a simple substitution cipher where one letter is substituted for another based on a fixed pattern.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li>Each letter in the plaintext maps to exactly one letter in the ciphertext</li>
                <li>The substitution remains constant throughout the message</li>
                <li>The alphabet can be scrambled in any of 26! different ways</li>
                <li>Once the substitution pattern is known, decryption is straightforward</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                For each plaintext letter p, the ciphertext letter c is generated using a fixed substitution function:
                <br>
                <code class="bg-gray-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">c = f(p)</code>
                <br>
                where f is a one-to-one mapping from the set of plaintext letters to the set of ciphertext letters.

                <li>Vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks</li>
                <li>Pattern recognition can break the cipher</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers have been used throughout history, from ancient civilizations to medieval times. They were considered secure until frequency analysis techniques were developed by Arab mathematicians in the 9th century.
