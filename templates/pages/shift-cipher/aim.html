    <p class="mb-4">
        A private-key encryption scheme consists of a set of all possible messages, called the message space M, 
        and three algorithms, namely:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li class="mb-2">(a) Gen</li>
        <li class="mb-2">(b) Enc</li>
        <li class="mb-2">(c) Dec</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
        The algorithm for key generation <span class="font-semibold">Gen</span> is used to choose a key k at 
        random from the set of all possible secret keys, denoted by the key space K.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        The algorithm for encryption <span class="font-semibold">Enc</span> takes as inputs the message m and 
        the secret key k and outputs the ciphertext c.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        The algorithm for decryption <span class="font-semibold">Dec</span> inputs the ciphertext c and the 
        key k and outputs the message m.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">About the experiment:</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
        Apparently, the system is easily broken if the total number of distinct secret keys is small, that is 
        the key space K is small.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        In this experiment, we work with a well-known historical encryption scheme, namely the shift cipher, 
        that has a very small key space.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        Your task is to break the shift cipher. Specifically, given (only) the ciphertext in some instance 
        of a shift cipher, you need to find the plaintext and the secret key.
